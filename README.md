# Webpack 4 example using sass

This webpack 4 configuration example includes:
1. Html loader.
1. Sass and mini-css-extract-plugin to work with css or scss files.
1. Hot reload webpack server.
1. React with a component example.


## Getting Started

All you need to start developing is run your server in development mode:
```
npm run webpack-dev-server
```

If you want to run it on production mode:
```
npm run webpack-prod-server
```

or you can generate the version ready for production running:
```
npm run webpack-prod
```

That will generate the files within /dist folder and then just open it
up the index.html in your browser.
